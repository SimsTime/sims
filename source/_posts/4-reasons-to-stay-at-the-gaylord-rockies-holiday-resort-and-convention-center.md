The Gaylord Rockies Vacation resort plus Convention Center is indeed equal parts “resort” and “convention center. ” Just opened in December 2018, it caters not only to vacationing couples and families with its fun indoor /outdoor water recreation area, but also convention and conference goers using its whopping 485, 000 square feet of conference space.

The Gaylord Rockies is a brief 15-minute get from Denver Airport Terminal. So , Perhaps you could just over night here, state, before hopping on a morning hours flight. But with all the current stuff to do as of this sprawling property - not forgetting a bevy of on-site restaurants and watering holes - I motivate visitors to consider producing the vacation resort a centerpiece of a Colorado vacation.

Here’s why you might book a ( long! ) stay at the Gaylord Rockies or say, “Yep! ” when your boss asks if you’d like to represent the company a convention here.

#### Activities galore

The hub of family entertainment at the Gaylord Rockies is the indoor/outdoor swimming pools. The indoor pool has water sprays and slides; there’s also a lap pool just for adults. Outside, find an outdoor infinity pool (open year round ) and lazy river ( open seasonally), plus a couple of sizzling tubs, and plenty of chairs for lounging.

I appreciate that kids ’ life jackets are available at no cost ( safety first! ), and if your children get tired of splashing in the pools, they can play a game of giant Jenga, giant Connect Four, or cornhole.

Steps away from the outdoor pool are pickleball, tennis and basketball courts (ask at the swim desk to use complimentary racquets and balls), plus a mini-golf program and bikes to borrow - with recreational paths nearby to cycle, as well.

To round out ways to remain entertained at the Gaylord Rockies, there’s an arcade space with a handful of video games; a spacious fitness center with the cardio and strength- teaching machines you’d need for a vacation workout; and a full- services spa with an “ice fountain” for cooling off before hopping in the steam space or sauna.

Finally, the 75-foot television screen in the Mountain Pass Sports Bar is worth checking out - actually if you’re not a huge sports fan. I couldn’t grasp the magnitude of its size until I saw it in person. If there’s a national sporting event or big game on while you’re at the Gaylord Rockies, this is certainly the destination to notice. Better however, if there are always a bunch of key video games on simultaneously, watch all of them - the mammoth viewing display screen can be split into up to 45 smaller screens simultaneously. Cozy chairs, with areas to rest beverages, makes this a great destination to go out with like-minded guests.

#### On-site eateries

Aside from the cavernous Mountain Move Sports Bar - an informal spot to nosh on burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and salads with a slew of draft beers - the Gaylord Rockies feeds guests at the more upscale Previous Hickory Steakhouse (a signature Gaylord Hotels cafe bought at other Gaylord properties). There’s also an Asian-themed cafe and sushi bar, plus an Italian cafe that doubles as a breakfast place in the morning.

On my (too brief ) overnight stay this wintertime, we found the breakfast buffet plentiful - your typically selection of offerings from cereal, oatmeal and toast to yogurt and fruit to sausage, fancy French toast and an omelet bar. We didn’t make it to the Rockies Industry or The Cocoa Bean for even more informal grab-and-go menu items the whole day.

#### Location, location

Seeing that noted, the Gaylord Rockies isn't far at most from DIA. Therefore, your Colorado holiday can commence within a few minutes of landing on the runway.

Now, it’s essential to learn that the vacation resort doesn’t present complimentary shuttle assistance to and from the airport terminal (like the majority of the area’s budget-friendly hotels do). It can offer free shuttle assistance to and from the light-rail station at 61st and Pena, and from there it’s a brief jaunt to the airport terminal upon this clean, reliable public transport option.

You may also take the light-rail into downtown’s Union Station - which is ideal since downtown parking could be pricey, and sometimes a pain in the neck to find on the road. Downtown Denver can be where you’ll find a large number of brewpubs; kid-friendly sights like Elitch Gardens amusement recreation area, Downtown Aquarium, and the U. S. Mint; the Pepsi Center for sports and concerts; a great deal of boutique buying and great restaurants; and museums just like the Denver Art Museum, Denver History Museum, and the Children’s Museum of Denver.

I love the idea of staying at the Gaylord Rockies as an alternative to staying downtown, which is where my family has typically rented a room (or two, with my teenagers! ) when we’ve visited the big city from our home in the mountains. I’ve got nothing against Denver’s high-rise downtown properties at all; they’re certainly convenient to a lot of the city’s must-visit attractions. But if you’re visiting Colorado from out of state, the Gaylord Rockies definitely has more of a “I’m on relaxing vacation ” vibe to it versus staying in an urban high-rise. Plus, as noted, downtown is easily accessible via public transport from the Gaylord Rockies.

If you’ve got an automobile and planning day journeys around Colorado’s Front Range, the Gaylord Rockies makes the perfect home foundation as you don’t need to fight downtown visitors, and you will easily visit I-70 or E-470 to create the right path to the college or university city of Boulder, hit the outlets in Castle Rock, or hike around Red Rocks Recreation area and also Ampitheatre.

#### Colorado scene

You’ll find out you’re in Colorado as soon as you set feet in the Gaylord Rockies, mainly because its décor and design capture the state’s feeling of place. Nods to character are everywhere

- whether it’s delicate tree bands in the meeting-room carpeting or landscape pictures on the wall space in the elevator lender. Guest areas feature lumberjack plaid print pillows, animal artwork, Indigenous American symbols etched in to the bathroom mirrors, and condition maps in the closets.

It’s in the massive Grand Lodge, just underneath the primary lobby where you’ll check in, where you may just feel like you’re actually outdoors in Colorado’s outside - for just two reasons. Initial, the 75-foot- high (eight-story) atrium window provides an unparalleled look at west of the Rocky Mountains. Second, moving waterfalls, a pond, boulders, sandy spots, trees, and additional vegetation are reminiscent of everything you might actually see on a hike not too far away.

In other words, this property was built and designed specifically to pay tribute to what makes Colorado so special - and it couldn’t be picked up and plopped down, say, in the middle of Georgia without feeling out of place. But since it’s right at the foot of the Rockies, and serving as a gateway to all the experiences and places that get you close to nature in my home state, the laid- back and outdoorsy vibe certainly fits the bill.
