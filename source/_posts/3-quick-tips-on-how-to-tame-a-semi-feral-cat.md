Did you know most of the homeless cats we contact “strays” are actually feral or semi-feral cats? Because of the wild nature and concern with human beings, these cats are hardly ever adopted and often euthanized.

When Alexis Chateau PR adopted me about December 13, 2016, I was a semi-feral cat. Here’s how our Controlling Director, Alexis Chateau, helped me come around.

#### Food

When confined to a home or shelter, a semi-feral cat will not understand how to find food, since he can no longer hunt. Use this to nurture a positive association between your existence and food. Keep in mind that a feral or semi-feral cat does not like to eat while you’re watching. Give us some space.

Still Semi-Feral, and cowering about the towel rack in the bathroom. This was my “you better not try to touch me, woman! ” face. > _ <

#### Catnip

Is your cat susceptible to catnip? If therefore, then taming them simply became easier. Catnip may either make your cat gradual and lazy, or bold and energetic. Effectively catnipped kitties may present reduced levels of dread, and may become more open to using you. The even more you enjoy with a cat, the higher the bond you type.

The 1st time I initiated get in touch with and jumped up into her lap. I’ve been doing this each day, since.: )

#### Patience

Alexis Chateau could tame me in only three weeks. Nevertheless, most feral and semi-feral cats might take up to half a year or more, to relationship with their Hoomanz. Due to this, patience is essential. Forcing a cat to relationship with you by cornering him or through undesirable petting will only result in hissing, biting, and scratching. Why don't we come to you.

With endurance, positive associations, and some pinches of catnip, I learned to simply accept and love my Hoomanz. In the event that you follow these pointers, your semi-feral may develop to like you, too. Don’t quit.
